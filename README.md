## About me:

Now with that out the way, let's talk about me!

**Who am I?**

I'm *Alex*, a 17 years old (soon to be) web developer. I am from Spain, and I speak *Spanish*, *Catalan*, *English* and a bit of *French*, so feel free to contact me in any of the languages mentioned. Started learning web development (seriously, at least), the 27th of April of 2023. I had spent a few months trying different languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C++ and C#. As I said, I was playing around with different aspects of programming, before deciding to start learning seriously Web Development.

**Hobbies**:

Evidently, programming is my passion, as it will allow me to create useful tools someday, and I am able to explore and pursue my own ideas and creations.

I also enjoy writing, I do write a lot of stories about mistery, detectives and crimes. I love it for the same reason I love programming, as I am able to do as I please with my own ideas.
